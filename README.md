# About the Project

## What are we predicting? Why does it matter?
A project based on kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa.
Proteins are the building blocks of our body. Diseases are usually caused when a protein malfunctions or overexpresses. Therefore, it is particularly useful to find molecules that can modulate the protein target and act as a drug. The mechanism through which a molecule responses to a cell is called Mechansim of Action or MoA. We are prediciting the MoA of molecules with a given training dataset. 

## What's hard about it?
The mechanisms of these molecules are highly complex. Since a molecule can have multiple MoA, this is **multi-label classfication problem**.
